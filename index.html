    <h2> Introduction  </h2>
    <p> 
        I am a first year Software Engineering student at RIT. I take a large interest in the technology of virtual reality, and some of
        my hobbies include modelling, texturing, and selling 3D clothing assets as well as making customized VRChat avatars on a commission basis.
        I went to high school at Carmel High School in Carmel, NY. There I wrestled for 3 years and became captain my Senior year. I also like to dance
        and recently started breakdancing.
