    <h2> Introduction  </h2>
    <p> 
        I am a first year Software Engineering student at RIT. I take a large interest in the technology of virtual reality, and some of
        my hobbies include modelling, texturing, and selling 3D clothing assets as well as making customized VRChat avatars on a commission basis.
        I went to high school at Carmel High School in Carmel, NY. There I wrestled for 3 years and became captain my Senior year. I also like to dance
        and recently started breakdancing. As you can see from the photo, I also have fursuit of my fursona an he is very cool :3

    <h3>
        Favorite Food
    </h3>
    <p>My favorite food is the sandwiches I used to eat back home at Deli Land. I worked at Deli Land for around <br>
    two years, and I know that they are made with fresh ingredients and taste amazing. Almost every sandwich I have <br>
    eaten at Deli Land has been a 10/10, and that is probably one of the only things I miss about my home. They also <br>
    make the best cheese steak I have ever tasted in my life.</p>
